### IoT Characteristics

IoT devices are often called “smart” devices because they have sensors and can conduct complex data analytics. IoT devices collect data using sensors and offer services to the
user based on the analyses of that data and according to user-defined parameters. For example, a smart refrigerator uses sensors (e.g., cameras) to inventory stored items and
can alert the user when items run low based on image recognition analyses. Sophisticated IoT devices can “learn” by recognizing patterns in user preferences and historical use data. An IoT device can become “smarter” as its program adjusts to improve its prediction capability so as to enhance user experiences or utility.

IoT devices are connected to the internet: directly, through another IoT device, or both. Network connections are used for sharing information and interacting with users. The IoT
creates linkages and connections between physical devices by incorporating software applications. IoT devices can enable users to access information or control devices from
anywhere using a variety of internet-connected devices. For example, a smart doorbell and lock may allow a user to see and interact with the person at the door and unlock the door
from anywhere using a mobile device or computer.

  IoT generally refers to devices—from sensors in vehicles to building thermostats— that collect information, communicate it to a network, and may complete a task based on that information. Although IoT technologies may present an opportunity for the federal government to operate more efficiently and effectively, federal agencies may also face challenges in acquiring and using IoT.

### Regulatory Issues

Emerging and converging technologies, such as IoT, may not align wholly with federal agency
oversight jurisdictions. New technologies may be left unregulated, partially regulated, or more fully regulated under a newly developed framework. They could also be left to self-regulate by the industry, which is the case for many consumer IoT devices. Federal regulation of IoT may entail policies for deconfliction, harmonization, and/or expansion of agency jurisdictions.

### Digital Privacy Issues

The IoT facilitates increased collection and consumption of data, posing potential privacy concerns. A piece or aggregation of the collected information could be used to identify, locate, track, or monitor an individual without the person’s knowledge. The revealed patterns in their activities may also be exploited.  The dilemma lies in that digital privacy and the advancement of smart technologies like IoT may be in direct opposition. Increased data collection and usage may yield innovation, technological progress, and improved utility, but could also lead to the erosion of privacy and data exploitation without consent.

### Data Security Issues

Connected devices and systems offer the possibility of ubiquitous access, which equates to more possible entry points for both authorized and unauthorized users. As more devices become connected to one another and to the internet, the risk and impact of a compromise
increase, along with the possibility of a cascading cyberattack. Data security is a tradeoff to consider between convenience and vulnerability.  

The IoT links cybersecurity and physical security. For example, when smart doors and locks are remotely controlled by a malicious actor through cyberattack, the physical security of that building also becomes compromised. The damage may not be limited to loss of digital content or information. Loss of data physically stored in the compromised location as well as personal security could be jeopardized.

Many IoT devices do not employ strong encryption at the device or user interface level. Not implementing strong encryption may be intentional due to associated benefits—it usually reduces cost, increases battery life of devices, minimizes memory requirements, reduces device size, and is easier to use or implement. However, a system may become easier to break into if IoT devices are the most vulnerable points of a system.
