### Applicable Laws & Guidance

[H.R.1668 - Internet of Things Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2020](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1668/text)
 
**Summary:**  To establish minimum security standards for Internet of Things devices owned or controlled by the Federal Government, and for other purposes.
 
**Considerations:** The strength of the cybersecurity of the Federal Government and the positive benefits of digital technology transformation depend on proactively addressing cybersecurity throughout the acquisition and operation of Internet of Things devices by the Federal Government.


### [How Far Does the New Federal IoT Law Reach?](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/how-far-does-the-new-federal-iot-law-5837222/)
 
**Summary:** Last December 2020, the [IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1668/text) became law in the U.S.  

**Considerations:** By December 5, 2022, all government agencies must no longer renew procurement contracts with companies where their IoT devices will not comply with [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov) standards and guidelines (see below).  Unsurprisingly, this also applies to new contracts.


### NIST Cybersecurity for IoT Program
 
**Summary:** Four public draft documents provide guidance for federal agencies and IoT device manufacturers on defining IoT cybersecurity requirements.  [The NIST released draft publications](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/nist-cybersecurity-iot-program) shortly after the law passed in December 2020 which discussed the proper security requirements for IoT devices. The drafts cover what agencies need to look for to ensure their devices are secure and how manufacturers should configure devices that they make for the Federal Government.  

- NIST Special Publication (SP) [800-213](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-213-draft) provides guidance to federal agencies on what they should ask for when they acquire these devices. 
- NIST Interagency Reports (NISTIRs) [8259B](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8259B-draft), [8259C](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8259C-draft) and [8259D](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8259D-draft), along with two previously released foundational publications in this series, [NISTIR 8259](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2020/NIST.IR.8259.pdf) and [NISTIR 8259A](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2020/NIST.IR.8259A.pdf), bring the current total in the series to five, and offer a suggested starting point for manufacturers who are building IoT devices for the federal government market.

As is the case with all NIST publications, the guidance itself is not regulatory.  However, NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements for federal systems.  Because companies that do business with government agencies will need to interact with technology the government finds acceptable, the guidance is likely to have far-reaching influence. 

**Considerations:**  NIST has a big role under the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act.  The Act requires NIST to create guidelines and standards for managing federal IoT devices by early March 2021.  GSA must adhere to the guidelines/standards created for management of IoT.

What Does It Take To Explore VR, AR, And MR?
- Research headsets; VR, AR and MR capabilities; and requirements of the hardware and software.
- Determine if your current computer system can handle the load.
- If it can’t, decide on a desktop or laptop that meets recommended requirements and has a high-performing CPU.
- Ensure the computer, the headset, and the game will all work well together.

Virtual Reality (VR) has been the “next big thing” for several years, but its time has finally come as a way to generate realistic images, sounds, and other sensations that put you smack in the middle of a spectacular imaginary world. Augmented Reality (AR), which adds virtual stuff to your real world environment, is contributing to the buzz, and both technologies should become a big part of our future. With Mixed Reality (MR), you can play a virtual video game, grab your real world water bottle, and smack an imaginary character from the game with the bottle. Imagination and reality have never been so intermingled.

So much is happening so fast that the differences between VR, AR, and MR can seem a little puzzling at first. Each of these spellbinding technologies are accessible to almost everyone, but before you throw down your hard-earned money for the latest head-mounted display, let’s take a closer look at what you’ll need for an amazing VR, AR, or MR experience.

### The History and Future of Virtual Reality

We’ve been trying to capture “Virtual Reality” for much longer than just the past five to ten years. There were popular peer-through toys in the 1950s and enclosed flight simulators debuted in the 1960s, but the idea of VR goes back even further.

As early as the 1930s, science fiction writers, inventors, and tinkerers dreamt of an environment where you could escape from reality via art and machines. We were weighing questions about Virtual Reality vs. Augmented Reality vs. Mixed Reality long before we had the technology to make them possible.

Technology has caught up to fiction, and market researchers predict rapid growth for the VR industry.

### VR and AR Meet MR

First things first, let’s define the terminology. Virtual Reality can be used as an umbrella term to describe other technologies similar to, but different from, an actual Virtual Reality experience. But what's the difference between Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality? Here are some more details:

### Virtual Reality

VR is the most widely known of these technologies. It is fully immersive, which tricks your senses into thinking you’re in a different environment or world apart from the real world. Using a head-mounted display (HMD) or headset, you’ll experience a computer-generated world of imagery and sounds in which you can manipulate objects and move around using haptic controllers while tethered to a console or PC.

### Augmented Reality

AR overlays digital information on real-world elements. Pokémon GO* is among the best-known examples. Augmented reality keeps the real world central but enhances it with other digital details, layering new strata of perception, and supplementing your reality or environment.

### Mixed Reality

MR brings together real world and digital elements. In mixed reality, you interact with and manipulate both physical and virtual items and environments, using next-generation sensing and imaging technologies. Mixed Reality allows you to see and immerse yourself in the world around you even as you interact with a virtual environment using your own hands—all without ever removing your headset. It provides the ability to have one foot (or hand) in the real world, and the other in an imaginary place, breaking down basic concepts between real and imaginary, offering an experience that can change the way you game and work today.

### Using Virtual Reality Technologies

From gaming, to movies, to medicine, the uses for Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality are expanding.

- **Healthcare**—For training, such as for surgical simulations
- **Film and TV**—For movies and shows to create unique experiences
- **Virtual travel**—For virtual trips to an art museum—or another planet—all from home
- **Professional sports**—For training programs like STRIVR to help pro and amateur athletes
- **Gaming**—For over 1,000 games already available, from first-person shooters to strategy games to role-playing adventures

### What You’ll Need: Headsets

There are many, many VR headsets available, all with varying performance levels and prices. Entry-level gear, such as Google Cardboard*, uses your mobile phone as the screen, whereas PC-operated devices, like the HTC Vive* or Oculus Rift*, are immersive—providing a premium VR environment. Microsoft has recently announced their Windows* 10 Mixed Reality platform that initially uses fully immersive headsets offered by Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung.

Some AR headsets are available on the market today, with more rumored to be coming in the future. The Microsoft Hololens*, Google Glass*, and the Meta 2* headset are great examples.

Every PC-connected HMD will have different system requirements, so if you’re buying a new Virtual Reality headset, make sure you check with the HMD vendor for their recommended and minimum system requirements.

### What You’ll Need: Computers

If you are looking for a new computer and you’re interested in VR, you’ll need something that can handle heavy loads. When it comes to high-end desktops or laptops for Virtual Reality (and other advanced tasks like gaming or video editing), the CPU, GPU, and memory are the most critical components.

Without these high-performing components working in sync, you could have a pretty miserable experience. A powerful system will ensure that you’ll have fun as you lean in, stand up, or walk around. VR that lags makes it impossible for the virtual world to respond as you expect, which can lead to more than just disappointment; it increases the risk of motion sickness.

A high-end processor assists in positional tracking and controls how real and immersive your virtual environment will be, so you'll enjoy a deeper experience in a higher-fidelity environment. For a great VR experience, consider the latest generation Intel Core™ i7 processor.

A discrete graphics processing unit (GPU) is recommended, or in the case of Oculus Rift*, HTC Vive*, and Windows Mixed Reality Ultra*, it is required. The GPU is responsible for rendering the high resolution, immersive images needed for VR. [Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/oculus-ready-pcs/), [HTC](https://www.vive.com/us/ready/), and [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/windows-mixed-reality-pc-check/9nzvl19n7cnc?rtc=1) all have profiler tools that you can download from their websites, and you can use to run on your PC to determine if it meets the minimum requirements for their VR headsets.

### Choose Your Experience

New VR and AR technologies and products continue to come to market, making new environments accessible to the masses. Virtual, Augmented, Mixed—the choice for a new reality is up to you. Let your imagination, and your readiness to try new gear, enhance your experience!

### Key VR Terms to Know

## Frames per second (FPS)

- Frequency at which a system can display consecutive images, or frames
- Without a high and constant frame rate (greater than 60 FPS), the motion won’t look right, and you could even feel sick

## Field of view

- The angle of the observable world that can be seen
- If the window of view is too narrow, you could end up making unnatural head rotations

## Degrees of Freedom (DoF)

- The number of directions that an object can move or rotate. The six degrees of freedom are pitch, roll, yaw, left and right, forward and backward, up and down
- More DoFs allow you to move more naturally in VR

## Latency

- The amount of time it takes a system to react/respond to movements or commands
- Latency is critical when it comes to the presence inside Virtual Reality—if the system doesn’t respond instantly, it doesn’t feel real.
