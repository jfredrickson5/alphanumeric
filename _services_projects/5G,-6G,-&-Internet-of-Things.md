### IoT Characteristics

IoT devices are often called “smart” devices because they have sensors and can conduct complex data analytics. IoT devices collect data using sensors and offer services to the
user based on the analyses of that data and according to user-defined parameters. For example, a smart refrigerator uses sensors (e.g., cameras) to inventory stored items and
can alert the user when items run low based on image recognition analyses. Sophisticated IoT devices can “learn” by recognizing patterns in user preferences and historical use data. An IoT device can become “smarter” as its program adjusts to improve its prediction capability so as to enhance user experiences or utility.

IoT devices are connected to the internet: directly, through another IoT device, or both. Network connections are used for sharing information and interacting with users. The IoT
creates linkages and connections between physical devices by incorporating software applications. IoT devices can enable users to access information or control devices from
anywhere using a variety of internet-connected devices. For example, a smart doorbell and lock may allow a user to see and interact with the person at the door and unlock the door
from anywhere using a mobile device or computer.

  IoT generally refers to devices—from sensors in vehicles to building thermostats— that collect information, communicate it to a network, and may complete a task based on that information. Although IoT technologies may present an opportunity for the federal government to operate more efficiently and effectively, federal agencies may also face challenges in acquiring and using IoT.

### COVID-19
IoT has the capability of transitioning many customer interactions that have been historically face-to-face, to more touchless interactions.  

Need a temporary laptop or new pair of headphones for video conferencing?  Need to access a shared tool at the job site?  IoT smart lockers would allow teams such as IT support and facilities management to permit access to select resources via automated request fulfillment applications.

Additionally, as GSA looks to incorporate more flex space into existing facilities, there is always the challenge of placing a user’s day use locker within general proximity to the desk location they have reserved for the day.  Smart lockers would allow for automated assignment of lockers based on desk reservations immediately or based on a booking trend.  This would reduce the employees foot traffic in a facility and permit them to operate within as an environment as possible.  

In a GSA scenario, an IoT solution integrated with BookIt! could orchestrate reservation availability based on the occupancy level of any given space.  For example, once the occupancy rate of a building’s wing exceeded 50%, the remainder of the desks would be blocked from reservation.  

### Climate & Sustainability
GSA IT has already piloted multiple IoT technologies geared toward space utilization.  Answer the question: Who is using what types of space, how, and when?  These insights may first be leveraged internally to make informed decisions regarding how best to configure valuable workspace.  Scaling this solution to all Federal facilities could be a baseline IT capability, with data shared across organizational boundaries.  

IoT capabilities, integrated into existing building automation systems (BAS), enables facility managers to scale space availability in real-team to meet tenant demands.  Meanwhile, areas not being utilized could receive reduced HVAC support to conserve energy.  In a GSA scenario, integration between BAS and BookIt! would orchestrate in what manner desks are made available for reservation, to ensure the most efficient use of space.  

### Applicable Laws & Guidance

[H.R.1668 - Internet of Things Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2020](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1668/text)
 
**Summary:**  To establish minimum security standards for Internet of Things devices owned or controlled by the Federal Government, and for other purposes.
 
**Considerations:** The strength of the cybersecurity of the Federal Government and the positive benefits of digital technology transformation depend on proactively addressing cybersecurity throughout the acquisition and operation of Internet of Things devices by the Federal Government.

### [How Far Does the New Federal IoT Law Reach?](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/how-far-does-the-new-federal-iot-law-5837222/)
 
**Summary:** Last December 2020, the [IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1668/text) became law in the U.S.  

**Considerations:** By December 5, 2022, all government agencies must no longer renew procurement contracts with companies where their IoT devices will not comply with [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov) standards and guidelines (see below).  Unsurprisingly, this also applies to new contracts.

### NIST Cybersecurity for IoT Program
 
**Summary:** Four public draft documents provide guidance for federal agencies and IoT device manufacturers on defining IoT cybersecurity requirements.  [The NIST released draft publications](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/nist-cybersecurity-iot-program) shortly after the law passed in December 2020 which discussed the proper security requirements for IoT devices. The drafts cover what agencies need to look for to ensure their devices are secure and how manufacturers should configure devices that they make for the Federal Government.  

- NIST Special Publication (SP) [800-213](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-213-draft) provides guidance to federal agencies on what they should ask for when they acquire these devices. 
- NIST Interagency Reports (NISTIRs) [8259B](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8259B-draft), [8259C](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8259C-draft) and [8259D](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8259D-draft), along with two previously released foundational publications in this series, [NISTIR 8259](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2020/NIST.IR.8259.pdf) and [NISTIR 8259A](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2020/NIST.IR.8259A.pdf), bring the current total in the series to five, and offer a suggested starting point for manufacturers who are building IoT devices for the federal government market.

As is the case with all NIST publications, the guidance itself is not regulatory.  However, NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements for federal systems.  Because companies that do business with government agencies will need to interact with technology the government finds acceptable, the guidance is likely to have far-reaching influence. 

**Considerations:**  NIST has a big role under the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act.  The Act requires NIST to create guidelines and standards for managing federal IoT devices by early March 2021.  GSA must adhere to the guidelines/standards created for management of IoT.

<div class="small-caps">Issues</div>

### Regulatory Issues

Emerging and converging technologies, such as IoT, may not align wholly with federal agency
oversight jurisdictions. New technologies may be left unregulated, partially regulated, or more fully regulated under a newly developed framework. They could also be left to self-regulate by the industry, which is the case for many consumer IoT devices. Federal regulation of IoT may entail policies for deconfliction, harmonization, and/or expansion of agency jurisdictions.

### Digital Privacy Issues

The IoT facilitates increased collection and consumption of data, posing potential privacy concerns. A piece or aggregation of the collected information could be used to identify, locate, track, or monitor an individual without the person’s knowledge. The revealed patterns in their activities may also be exploited.  The dilemma lies in that digital privacy and the advancement of smart technologies like IoT may be in direct opposition. Increased data collection and usage may yield innovation, technological progress, and improved utility, but could also lead to the erosion of privacy and data exploitation without consent.

### Data Security Issues

Connected devices and systems offer the possibility of ubiquitous access, which equates to more possible entry points for both authorized and unauthorized users. As more devices become connected to one another and to the internet, the risk and impact of a compromise
increase, along with the possibility of a cascading cyberattack. Data security is a tradeoff to consider between convenience and vulnerability.  

The IoT links cybersecurity and physical security. For example, when smart doors and locks are remotely controlled by a malicious actor through cyberattack, the physical security of that building also becomes compromised. The damage may not be limited to loss of digital content or information. Loss of data physically stored in the compromised location as well as personal security could be jeopardized.

Many IoT devices do not employ strong encryption at the device or user interface level. Not implementing strong encryption may be intentional due to associated benefits—it usually reduces cost, increases battery life of devices, minimizes memory requirements, reduces device size, and is easier to use or implement. However, a system may become easier to break into if IoT devices are the most vulnerable points of a system.
